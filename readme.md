# vuejs-wordpress-theme-starter
A true WordPress theme with the guts ripped out and replaced with Vue. Based on the [BlankSlate](https://github.com/tidythemes/blankslate) WP starter theme.

**Who's this for?** When I started diving into using Vue in WordPress I found plenty of great starters for headless WordPress, but I had the added constraint of needing to run the front and backend on the same host, thus this project was created.

## Features
- [VueRouter](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) integrated
- [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) integrated (with sample WordPress-centric modules)
- jQuery integrated, if that's your thing
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) support and sample config
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API requests
- Follows the development guidelines/structure set forth by Vuejs
- Bare essentials needed for a functional WordPress theme
- All requests are redirected back to the index.php so your Vue routing is respected.
- SCSS support
- Bootstrap 4 Beta

## Getting started
- Clone the repo inside of your `wp-content/themes/` directory
- Navigate to the theme directory and run
    `npm install`
    `npm run watch` for development
    `npm run production` when you're ready to deploy the theme.

## New to Vue?
Not sure where to begin? I highly recommend the free [Learn Vue 2: Step By Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step) course over at Laracasts. There's also a [great playlist by Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXY1UyQfSFw&list=PL55RiY5tL51qxUbODJG9cgrsVd7ZHbPrt) available on YouTube that covers pretty much everything you'd want to know about building a fully-featured Vue app.

If you're new to Vue/Vuex I would do the following:

- Open up `src/app.js` this is the main JS file for the app and will give you a glimpse into what's going on behind the scenes.
- Next open up `src/App.vue` this is the primary app component, a page wrapper of sorts. It contains the header/footer and the `<router-view>` component which is what loads in all of the other screens as you navigate around the app. Note that by default `src/components/Home.vue` is loaded into the `router-view` initially.
- Next open up `src/routes/index.js` and notice how the routes are setup by default. Out of the box there is only one route, the `/` or home view. For more information on setting up routing within your app checkout [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).
- Next is the Vuex store. I won't cover how that works here as it's a tiny bit more advanced. Check out all files in `src/store` and start to familiarize yourself with what's going on. It's based on the official Vuex example project setup and uses Vuex modules. By default I've included a couple of modules I thought you might need.

The first thing you're probably going to want to do is start editing and components in `src/components/`. 

## Code Organization
All of the code you're going to edit is located in `/src/`. From there it's broken into a few logical directories.

- `/src`
  - `/api` for API requests
  - `/assets` for images mostly
  - `/components` Vue components
  - `/router` vue-router directives
  - `/store` vuex store and modules
  - `/styles` SCSS styles
  - `/vendor` 3rd party scripts and libraries

All scripts and styles in `/src` are compiled down to the `/dist` directory, which is what you will deploy. **When you're ready to deploy don't deploy the src/ directory.**
